	<p>
		I’m Youssef — a software developer focused on backend engineering and distributed systems.
		I enjoy turning messy, real-world constraints into systems that are observable, scalable,
		and resilient.
	</p>

	<p>
		My day-to-day work revolves around backend-heavy problems: microservices, asynchronous
		workloads, and the “boring but critical” foundations — data flow, failure modes,
		timeouts, retries, backpressure, and performance under load. I care a lot about reliability
		and debugging clarity: shipping something that works is good; shipping something you can
		understand in production is better.
	</p>

	<p>
		Technically, I spend most of my time around APIs and service communication (REST, gRPC),
		databases (often PostgreSQL), caching layers (Redis), and deployment and automation workflows
		(Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes). I prefer well-structured systems, explicit interfaces,
		and pragmatic trade-offs over clever abstractions.
	</p>

	<h2>What I write about</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Building reliable backend systems (resilience, retries, timeouts, backpressure)</li>
		<li>Distributed systems concepts explained through real-world examples</li>
		<li>Performance under load (bottlenecks, pools, queueing, observability)</li>
		<li>Architecture notes from real projects — what worked, what didn’t, and why</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Why this blog</h2>
	<p>
		I started this blog primarily to share what I learn while building and operating backend systems.
		Writing helps me clarify my own thinking, and sharing helps others avoid the same mistakes.
	</p>

	<p>
		At the same time, this blog is a way to make my work and interests visible. If you’re looking
		for someone who enjoys digging into reliability, performance, and system behavior in production,
		this blog gives a good sense of how I think and work.
