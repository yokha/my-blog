	<p>
		I’m Youssef — a software developer focused on backend engineering and distributed systems.
		I enjoy turning messy, real-world constraints into systems that are observable, scalable,
		and resilient.
	</p>

	<p>
		My day-to-day work lives close to production reality: backend-heavy systems, asynchronous
		workloads, and the “boring but critical” foundations — data flow, failure modes,
		timeouts, retries, backpressure, and performance under load. I care deeply about reliability
		and debugging clarity: shipping something that works is good; shipping something you can
		reason about when it fails is better.
	</p>

	<p>
		Technically, I spend most of my time around APIs and service communication (REST, gRPC),
		databases (often PostgreSQL), caching layers (Redis), and deployment and automation workflows
		(Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes). I tend to favor explicit designs, clear interfaces,
		and pragmatic trade-offs over clever abstractions that hide complexity.
	</p>

	<h2>What I write about</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Building reliable backend systems (resilience, retries, timeouts, backpressure)</li>
		<li>Concurrency and async design, from threads to event-driven systems</li>
		<li>Performance under load (bottlenecks, pools, queueing, observability)</li>
		<li>Distributed systems concepts explained through real projects and real failures</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Why this blog</h2>
	<p>
		I started this blog as a place to write down lessons while they’re still fresh — patterns,
		mistakes, and small insights that don’t always make it into formal documentation.
		Writing helps me sharpen my own understanding, and sharing helps others avoid rediscovering
		the same problems the hard way.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is also where I explore how modern backend systems are actually built and operated:
		where theory meets constraints, and where good engineering judgment matters more than
		perfect diagrams.
	</p>

	<p>
		If something here resonates with how you think about software, you’ll probably find more
		of that mindset throughout the blog.
