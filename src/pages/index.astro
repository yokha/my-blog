				I’m a software developer with a strong backend focus. I build systems that stay calm under load:
				clear interfaces, predictable data flows, good observability, and reliability-first trade-offs.
			</p>

			<p>
				I work mostly with microservice-style systems and asynchronous workloads—APIs (REST/gRPC),
				databases (often PostgreSQL), caching (Redis), and automation/deployments (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes).
				I’m also comfortable closer to the metal (embedded / microelectronics background), which helps when
				debugging real-world constraints and failure modes.
			</p>

			<p>
				On this blog I share practical notes on modern software development:
				reliability and resilience (timeouts, retries, backpressure),
				concurrency and async design (from multithreading to event loops),
				performance bottlenecks, and the fundamentals that make production
				systems observable and debuggable.
