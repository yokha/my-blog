I’m Youssef. I build backend systems and care a lot about fundamentals:
data flow, failure modes, observability, and performance.

This blog is where I’ll write short, practical notes on things I learn while building
distributed services (async, databases, caching, event-driven patterns, etc.).

If you’re working on reliability, scalability, or “it works locally but not in prod” problems,
you’ll probably feel at home here.
